This GitHub project has been created in order to provide a location on the World Wide Web at which are stored the Mathematica Notebooks accompanying David Blower's Volume IV.
There is a "Supporting Notebook" for each of the six chapters in Volume IV, and several other Notebooks connected to the Supporting Notebooks.
There is also an "Editors' Apologia" Notebook and an "Appendix A" Notebook.
The critical Notebook is called IP.nb, which is a Mathematica/Wolfram Language package file, from which the use creates and installs an IP.m file.
The IP package contains definitions of all the functions used throughout the Supporting and other Notebooks, and is therefore strictly necessary for the Notebooks
to execute as intended.
