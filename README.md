# Volume-IV-Notebooks
Mathematica Notebooks for David Blower's Volume IV,  Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks
This GitHub project has been created in order to provide a location on the World Wide Web for the supporting Mathematica Notebooks
accompanying David Blower's Volume IV.
There is a "Supporting Notebook" for each of the six chapters in Volume IV, and several auxiliary Notebooks containing extra material created by Romke Bontekoe and Barrie J Stokes, meant to further assist a reader of Volume IV.
If all the Notebooks are located in a single folder, Buttons within the Supporting Notebooks will open the auxiliary Notebooks.
An Import[] statement in the Supporting Notebook for Chapter 54 will similarly access the correct .txt data file.
There is a Mathematica package Notebook, IP.nb, which must be installed in the user's system, since it is called by all the Supporting Notebooks.
