# Volume-IV-Notebooks
Mathematica Notebooks for David Blower's Volume IV,  Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks.
This GitHub project has been created in order to provide a location on the World Wide Web for the supporting Mathematica Notebooks
accompanying David Blower's Volume IV.
There is a "Supporting Notebook" for each of the six chapters in Volume IV, and several auxiliary Notebooks containing extra material created by Romke Bontekoe and Barrie J Stokes, meant to further assist a reader of Volume IV.
If all the Notebooks are located in a single folder, Buttons within the Supporting Notebook for Chapter 54 will open some auxiliary Notebooks.
An Import[] statement in the Supporting Notebook for Chapter 54 will similarly access the correct .txt data file.
There is a Mathematica package Notebook, IP.nb, which must be installed in the user's system, since it is called by all the Supporting Notebooks.
Also included here are the PDF files for Volumes I, I (Supplementary Execises), II, III, and IV of David Blower's "Information Processing" series.
