# Volume-IV-Notebooks
Mathemaica Notebooks for David Blower's Volume IV,  Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks


This GitHub project has been created in order to provide a location on the World Wide Web at which are stored the Mathematica Notebooks
accompanying David Blower's Volume IV.
There is a "Supporting Notebook" for each of the six chapters in Volume IV, and a "Supplementary Notebook" containing extra material created by Romke and Barrie,
meant to assist a reader of Volume IV.
